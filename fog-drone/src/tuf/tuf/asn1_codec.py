  Normal behavior ("resign" (re-sign) parameter being False) converts the
  basic Python dictionary format of signed_metadata provided into ASN.1 and
  encodes it as DER, returning the resulting DER encoding of the given metadata.

  "_signed" here refers to the portion of the metadata that will be signed.
  The metadata is divided into "signed" and "signature" portions. The
  signatures are signatures over the "signed" portion. "json_signed" below
  is actually not signed - it is simply the portion that will be put into
  the "signed" section - the portion to be signed. The nomenclature is

  TODO: Better variable and function naming.

  <Arguments>
    signed_metadata
      Role metadata and signature(s) over it.
      A dictionary with keys 'signed' and 'signatures'.
      signed_metadata must conform to tuf.formats.SIGNABLE_SCHEMA.
      Further, the 'signed' entry in signed_metadata must conform to
      tuf.formats.ANYROLE_SCHEMA.

    resign
      ("re-sign"). Normally False, resulting in the signatures in
      signed_metadata being formatted as ASN.1 and encoded as DER, but otherwise
      preserved.
      If resign is instead True, any signatures provided are
      discarded, and a new signature is generated. This new signature will be
      over the DER encoding of the data provided in signed_metadata['signed'].
      In other words, 'signed' will first be converted into ASN.1 and then
      encoded as DER, and a signature will be made using the given private_key,
      over that DER encoding.
      If the given signatures are already over DER encoding before reaching
      this point (as may happen in the current design), then you will not
      need this to be True....
      # TODO: <~> Revise above comment after you're finished.

    private_key
      This should be left out (None) unless resign is True, in which case
      private_key must conform to tuf.formats.ANYKEY_SCHEMA, containing a
      private key, specifically. It will be used to re-sign the metadata
      provided in signed_metadata['signed'].
      Such a key can be imported, for example, through the
      tuf.repository_tool.import_*_private_key() functions.

    only_signed
      Default False. If this is set to True, instead of returning the DER
      encoding of the full {'signed': {"abc..."}, 'signatures': [{"xyz..."}]}
      object, the DER encoding of only the 'signed' entry will be returned
      {"abc..."}.

  <Returns>
    By default (only_signed=False, resign=False), the returned value is the DER
    encoding of the full signed_metadata dictionary.

    If only_signed is True, the returned value is the DER encoding of only the
    'signed' entry in the signed_metadata dictionary.

    Otherwise, if resign is True, the returned value is the DER encoding of the
    full signed_metadata dictionary, but with the 'signatures' entry
    discarded and rebuilt anew with a new signature over the DER ENCODING of the
    'signed' entry in the signed_metadata dictionary.
