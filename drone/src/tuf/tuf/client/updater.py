<Purpose>
  'updater.py' is intended to be the only TUF module that software update
  systems need to utilize.  It provides a single class representing an
  updater that includes methods to download, install, and verify
  metadata/target files in a secure manner.  Importing 'updater.py' and
  instantiating its main class is all that is required by the client prior
  to a TUF update request.  The importation and instantiation steps allow
  TUF to load all of the required metadata files and set the repository mirror
  information.

  An overview of the update process:

  1. The software update system instructs TUF to check for updates.

  2. TUF downloads and verifies timestamp.json.

  3. If timestamp.json indicates that snapshot.json has changed, TUF downloads
     and verifies snapshot.json.

  4. TUF determines which metadata files listed in snapshot.json differ from
     those described in the last snapshot.json that TUF has seen.  If root.json
     has changed, the update process starts over using the new root.json.

  5. TUF provides the software update system with a list of available files
     according to targets.json.

  6. The software update system instructs TUF to download a specific target
     file.

  7. TUF downloads and verifies the file and then makes the file available to
     the software update system.

<Example Client>

  # The client first imports the 'updater.py' module, the only module the
  # client is required to import.  The client will utilize a single class
  # from this module.
  import tuf.client.updater

  # The only other module the client interacts with is 'tuf.conf'.  The
  # client accesses this module solely to set the repository directory.
  # This directory will hold the files downloaded from a remote repository.
  tuf.conf.repository_directory = 'local-repository'

  # OLD: repository_mirrors format has changed. REWRITE AFTER DESIGN CONFIRM:
    # Next, the client creates a dictionary object containing the repository
    # mirrors.  The client may download content from any one of these mirrors.
    # In the example below, a single mirror named 'mirror1' is defined.  The
    # mirror is located at 'http://localhost:8001', and all of the metadata
    # and targets files can be found in the 'metadata' and 'targets' directory,
    # respectively.  If the client wishes to only download target files from
    # specific directories on the mirror, the 'confined_target_dirs' field
    # should be set.  In the example, the client has chosen '', which is
    # interpreted as no confinement.  In other words, the client can download
    # targets from any directory or subdirectories.  If the client had chosen
    # 'targets1/', they would have been confined to the '/targets/targets1/'
    # directory on the 'http://localhost:8001' mirror. 
    repository_mirrors = {'mirror1': {'url_prefix': 'http://localhost:8001',
                                      'metadata_path': 'metadata',
                                      'targets_path': 'targets',
                                      'confined_target_dirs': ['']}}

  # The updater may now be instantiated.  The Updater class of 'updater.py'
  # is called with two arguments.  The first argument assigns a name to this
  # particular updater and the second argument the repository mirrors defined
  # above.
  updater = tuf.client.updater.Updater('updater', repository_mirrors)

  # The client next calls the refresh() method to ensure it has the latest
  # copies of the metadata files.
  updater.refresh()

  # The target file information for all the repository targets is determined.
  targets = updater.all_targets()
  
  # Among these targets, determine the ones that have changed since the client's
  # last refresh().  A target is considered updated if it does not exist in
  # 'destination_directory' (current directory) or the target located there has
  # changed.
  destination_directory = '.'
  updated_targets = updater.updated_targets(targets, destination_directory)

  # Lastly, attempt to download each target among those that have changed.
  # The updated target files are saved locally to 'destination_directory'.
  for target in updated_targets:
    updater.download_target(target, destination_directory)

  def __init__(self, updater_name):
    """
    <Purpose>

      Constructor.  Instantiating an updater object reads pinned.json into
      memory and instantiates a SingleRepoUpdater object for each repository
      entry in the pinned.json metadata. This causes all the metadata files for
      the files for the top- level roles to be read from disk, including the
      key and role information for the delegated targets of 'targets'.  The
      actual metadata for delegated roles is not loaded in __init__.  The
      metadata for these delegated roles, including nested delegated roles, are
      loaded, updated, and saved to the 'self.metadata' store by the target
      methods, like all_targets() and targets_of_role().

      The initial set of metadata files (critically, root.json) is provided by
      the software update system utilizing TUF.

      There are several requirements to be able to instantiate an updater:

      1.  The pinned.json file is expected to be in the following location:
            {tuf.conf.repository_directory}/metadata/pinned.json
          See TAP 4 at github.com/theupdateframework/taps for more information.

      2.  For each repository, the following directories must already exist
          locally:
            {tuf.conf.repository_directory}/metadata/<repository_name>/current
            {tuf.conf.repository_directory}/metadata/<repository_name>/previous

      3.  For each repository, the "current" root metadata file must exist:
            {tuf.conf.repository_directory}/metadata/<repository_name>/current/root.json

    <Arguments>
      updater_name:
        A name to refer to this updater. TODO: Explain why we still need this
        in this new class, if we do. (Don't yet see a reason)

    <Exceptions>
      tuf.FormatError:
        If the arguments are improperly formatted.

      tuf.RepositoryError:
        If there is an error with the updater's repository files, such
        as a missing 'root.json' file.

    <Side Effects>

      pinned.json is read from disk and stored in this new object.
      For each repository, the metadata files (e.g., 'root.json',
      'targets.json') for the top- level roles are read from disk and stored in
      dictionaries.  In addition, the key and roledb modules are populated with
      'repository_name' entries.

    must be provided. (If only one repository is listed in this updater, then
    that repository is used.)

    <Arguments>

      target_filepath
        the filename of the sought target, relative to the root of the targets
        namespace

      repo_name (optional)
        If specified, the target will be sought from the given repository only,
        regardless of which repository is delegated a path matching the
        given target_filepath

      multi_custom (optional)
        Determines the treatment of custom target info (the optional 'custom'
        field in tuf.formats.FILEINFO_SCHEMA) in the event that there are
        multi-repository delegations.
        # TODO: Support this for multi-role delegation as well for
        # consistency, even though there is no pressing need.

        The intention here is to optionally allow the client to pick through
        potentially differing 'custom' fields in the otherwise-identical
        fileinfo from different sources when all of those sources are required
        to agree (in a multi-repository delegation). This behavior may change:
        it is confusing. There is a good chance that people will misinterpret
        this as returning target info existing at different priority levels,
        from different delegations: this is not that. The info returned will
        *always be from a single pinning delegation* (which may have multiple
        required repositories).

        If set to the default, False, no more than one fileinfo will be
        returned.

        If set to True, behavior is more complex. If a multi- repository
        delegation is involved in the chain of trust specifying the valid
        target fileinfo that would be returned -- that is, if there are
        multiple roles or repositories that had to specify matching target
        fileinfo for the fileinfo to be returned -- all of those (matching)
        fileinfo dictionaries are returned. These will match in all respects
        except, potentially, the 'custom' field, since that does not need to be
        equal in order for the fileinfo to be treated as matching.

        An example return value, if multi_custom is set to True and pinned.json
        specifies a multi-repository delegation for targets in target directory
        'django' for which two repositories, 'PyPI' and 'DjangoSecure' must
        agree on target info in order for that info to be valid.
        {
          'DjangoSecure': {

            filepath: 'django/django.1.9.3.tgz',
            fileinfo: {hashes: ..., length: ... } } }
        }


        # TODO: A new test case must be written for these scenarios.


    <Returns>
      By default, a single fileinfo dict, compliant with
      tuf.formats.TARGETFILE_SCHEMA. This metadata describes a trustworthy
      target file matching the given target_filepath, certified by the
      repository(/ies) connected to. If multiple matching targetfile infos were
      encountered in a multi-repo delegation, there is no guarantee provided of
      which one will be returned (they are only permitted to differ in their
      'custom' field.)

      If multi_custom is True, this will instead be a dict of such objects. If
      a multi-repository delegation is encountered, there will be one such
      object in the dict for every repository that is required in the multi-

  <Purpose>
    Provide a class that can download target files securely.  The updater
    keeps track of currently and previously trusted metadata, target files
    available to the client, target file attributes such as file size and 
    hashes, key and role information, metadata signatures, and the ability
    to determine when the download of a file should be permitted.

  <Updater Attributes>
    self.metadata:
      Dictionary holding the currently and previously trusted metadata.
      
      Example: {'current': {'root': ROOT_SCHEMA,
                            'targets':TARGETS_SCHEMA, ...},
                'previous': {'root': ROOT_SCHEMA,
                             'targets':TARGETS_SCHEMA, ...}}
    
    self.metadata_directory:
      The directory where trusted metadata is stored.
      
    self.versioninfo:
      A cache of version numbers for the roles available on the repository.
      
      Example: {'targets.json': {'version': 128}, ...}

    self.mirrors:
      The repository mirrors from which metadata and targets are available.
      Conformant to 'tuf.formats.ALT_MIRRORLIST_SCHEMA'.
    
    self.repository_name:
      This is the name of the repository that this updater object will use.
      It is expected to be the name of the repository as you would see it in
      pinned.json, and in the roledb and keydb dictionaries.

    self.root_override_URLs:
      This is an optional argument that allows us to specify the url from which
      to retrieve root.json in particular. This is of use for key-pinning
      configurations in which there is a custom (local, or separately remotely
      hosted) root file, but the rest of the metadata is still available at
      the expected location for the repository.




  <Updater Methods>
    refresh():
      This method downloads, verifies, and loads metadata for the top-level
      roles in a specific order (i.e., timestamp -> snapshot -> root -> targets)
      The expiration time for downloaded metadata is also verified.
      
      The metadata for delegated roles are not refreshed by this method, but by
      the target methods (e.g., all_targets(), targets_of_role(), target()).
      The refresh() method should be called by the client before any target
      requests.
    
    all_targets():
      Returns the target information for the 'targets' and delegated roles.
      Prior to extracting the target information, this method attempts a file
      download of all the target metadata that have changed.
    
    targets_of_role('targets'):
      Returns the target information for the targets of a specified role.
      Like all_targets(), delegated metadata is updated if it has changed.
    
    target(file_path):
      Returns the target information for a specific file identified by its file
      path.  This target method also downloads the metadata of updated targets.
    
    updated_targets(targets, destination_directory):
      After the client has retrieved the target information for those targets
      they are interested in updating, they would call this method to determine
      which targets have changed from those saved locally on disk.  All the
      targets that have changed are returns in a list.  From this list, they
      can request a download by calling 'download_target()'.
    
    download_target(target, destination_directory):
      This method performs the actual download of the specified target.  The
      file is saved to the 'destination_directory' argument.

    remove_obsolete_targets(destination_directory):
      Any files located in 'destination_directory' that were previously
      served by the repository but have since been removed, can be deleted
      from disk by the client by calling this method.

    Note: The methods listed above are public and intended for the software
    updater integrating TUF with this module.  All other methods that may begin
    with a single leading underscore are non-public and only used internally.
    updater.py is not subclassed in TUF, nor is it designed to be subclassed,
    so double leading underscores is not used.

      metadata for delegated roles is not loaded in __init__.  The metadata
      for these delegated roles, including nested delegated roles, are
      loaded, updated, and saved to the 'self.metadata' store by the target

    """
    <Purpose>
      Update the latest copies of the metadata for the top-level roles. The
      update request process follows a specific order to ensure the metadata
      files are securely updated:
      timestamp -> snapshot -> root (if necessary) -> targets.
      
      Delegated metadata is not refreshed by this method. After this method is
      called, the use of target methods (e.g., all_targets(),
      targets_of_role(), or target()) will update delegated metadata, when
      required.  Calling refresh() ensures that top-level metadata is
      up-to-date, so that the target methods can refer to the latest available
      content. Thus, refresh() should always be called by the client before any
      requests of target file information.

      The expiration time for downloaded metadata is also verified, including
      local metadata that the repository claims is up to date.

      If the refresh fails for any reason, then unless
      'unsafely_update_root_if_necessary' is set, refresh will be retried once
      after first attempting to update the root metadata file. Only after this
      check will the exceptions listed here potentially be raised.

      Note that "unsafely update root" is misleading. It refers to updating the
      root metadata even if we don't have updated timestamp/snapshot metadata
      that vouches for it, but we don't really need this vouching, which we're
      removing anyway. We don't need to care what the snapshot file says about

    <Purpose>
      Non-public method that updates the metadata for 'metadata_role' if it has
      changed.  With the exception of the 'timestamp' role, all the top-level
      roles are updated by this method.  The 'timestamp' role is always
      downloaded from a mirror without first checking if it has been updated; it
      is updated in refresh() by calling _update_metadata('timestamp').  This
      method is also called for delegated role metadata, which are referenced by
      'snapshot'.
        
      If the metadata needs to be updated but an update cannot be obtained,
      this method will delete the file (with the exception of the root
      metadata, which never gets removed without a replacement).

      Due to the way in which metadata files are updated, it is expected that
      'referenced_metadata' is not out of date and trusted.  The refresh()
      method updates the top-level roles in 'timestamp -> snapshot ->
      root -> targets' order.  For delegated metadata, the parent role is
      updated before the delegated role.  Taking into account that
      'referenced_metadata' is updated and verified before 'metadata_role',
      this method determines if 'metadata_role' has changed by checking
      the 'meta' field of the newly updated 'referenced_metadata'.

    <Arguments>
      metadata_role:
        The name of the metadata. This is a role name and should not end
        in '.json'.  Examples: 'root', 'targets', 'unclaimed'.

        This is the metadata that provides the role information for
        'metadata_role'.  For the top-level roles, the 'snapshot' role
        is the referenced metadata for the 'root', and 'targets' roles.
        The 'timestamp' metadata is always downloaded regardless.  In
        other words, it is updated by calling _update_metadata('timestamp')
        and not by this method.  The referenced metadata for 'snapshot'
        is 'timestamp'.  See refresh().

      store (i.e., self.metadata) is updated with the new metadata and the
      affected stores modified (i.e., the previous metadata store is updated).
